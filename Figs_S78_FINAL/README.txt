This is the code for Suppl. Figs 7 and 8.

The *.mat files contain simulation data generated from:
FIG_S7_SIMULATIONS.m and
FIG_S8_SIMULATIONS.m (+ a version of this script with pwr=0.5, not included).

FIG_S7_MAKE_PANELS.m (panel 7d takes 1-2 mins to generate so be patient) and
FIG_S8_MAKE_PANELS.m 
use the simulated data to generate all panels in Fig S7 and S8 (minus panel 8a), 
and save them as PDFs.
